# Programming Challenge

Presented whith the challenge of coding a "contact app", I decided to use React.js for the UI, and my own personal .css stying without help of a styling library to develop a fully responsive web application. 


## Description

Even though sometimes React js can be a over-statement for a small project, it is a good framework to use when you're manipulating front-end information and having to pass it on from one component to the other thanks to the Flux and Redux. I also could've used plane old javascript and even manipulate route with a node/express code but decided to go for the newer and more challenging way. Style and detail is very important, that's why I always go for costume made .css styling.
