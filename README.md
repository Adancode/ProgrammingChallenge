# Programming Challenge

Presented whith the challenge of coding a "contact app", I decided to use React.js for the UI, and my own personal .css stying without help of a styling library to develop a fully responsive web application. 


## Description

Even though sometimes React js can be a over-statement for a small project, it is a good framework to use when you're manipulating front-end information and having to pass it on from one component to the other thanks to the Flux and Redux. I also could've used plane old javascript and even manipulate route with a node/express code but decided to go for the newer and more challenging way. Style and detail is very important, that's why I always go for costume made .css styling.

### Installation

Go ahead an clone the reposetory on your terminal/gitBash window. Run the command 'npm install', all the dependencies you need will be in the package.json. Once you have your node.js installed, just type 'npm start'. The app will open a tab in your browser.
